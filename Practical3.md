# **Practical 3: OwnerRestricted**

# STEPS
**How to Test in Remix**

Paste the code into a new file OwnerRestricted.sol.

Compile the contract.

Deploy using an account (this account becomes the owner).

Call secretFunction() – it should succeed.

Change the account (top-left in Remix) and call secretFunction() again – it should fail with: Not the contract owner.
